SWISH-Filter
=========================

ABOUT

SWISH::Filter is a suite of modules for converting multiple formats
into HTML, XML or plain text. It is intended for use with Swish-e
but can be used all on its own.

SWISH::Filter relies on MIME types to call pluggable filter modules,
which may in turn call external programs to perform the actual filtering.
SWISH::Filters::Base defines an API for writing your own filters.
